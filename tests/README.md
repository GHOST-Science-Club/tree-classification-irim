By default, pytest uses CLI options listed in the `pyproject.toml` file, but you can overide this behavior by passing your own arguments (see [pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html) for details).

 `Tox` uses `tox.ini` for it configuration, which you can override to a certain extent (see [tox docs](https://tox.wiki/en/4.24.2/cli_interface.html) for more details).
