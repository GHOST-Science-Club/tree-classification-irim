## About the Project

**GHOST x IRIM** is an initiative by the [GHOST](https://ghost.put.poznan.pl) student organization to develop and test
an AI algorithm for identifying tree species from aerial photos, focusing on Polish forests.

### How to run the project üí°

! Python 3.10+ is required to run code from this repo.
If you run into any issues, please check your Python version.

Clone the repo and cd into:

```
git clone git@github.com:GHOST-Science-Club/tree-classification-irim.git
cd tree-classification-irim
```

For Linux/MacOS/Unix:

```
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r unix-requirements.txt
python3.10 src/main.py
```

For CUDA PyTorch installation, please refer to this link: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and select your
platform and CUDA.
For Windows with CUDA and win32 lib:

```
python3.10 -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3.10 src/main.py
```

If you are a project maintainer you should have received Wandb api key.
To send logs from local builds to wandb use:

```
pip install wandb
wandb login
```

Provide your API key when prompted.


### How to test the project üí°

Before running tests, ensure your setup follows the [How to run the project](#how-to-run-the-project-) section. You can test locally using **`pytest`** (faster) or **`tox`** (more comprehensive). See [`tests/README.md`](https://github.com/GHOST-Science-Club/tree-classification-irim/tree/main/tests) for details.

**1. Pytest (Recommended for Quick Testing)**  
Pytest runs tests *quickly* without creating isolated environments. Use it for *as-you-go* testing:  

```bash
pytest
```  
This prints test results to the terminal and generates coverage reports in `htmlcov/`.  

**2. Tox (Recommended Before Pushing)**  
Tox tests in *multiple environments* (e.g., different Python versions), ensuring system-independent compatibility.  

```bash
tox
```  
Like `pytest`, it prints results to the terminal and saves coverage data in `htmlcov/`. ‚ö† *First run may take longer* as environments are set up (subsequent runs are faster due to caching).

### Additional Checks üìã

**Type Checking with `mypy`**

Run static type checks to catch typing errors:

```bash
mypy
```

**Linting with `ruff`**

Check for code quality issues:

```bash
ruff check
```

To auto-fix simple issues:

```bash
ruff format --fix
```

For more complex issues, manual refactoring may be required.

**Formatting with `ruff format`**

Check formatting only:

```bash
ruff format --check
```

See suggested changes:

```bash
ruff format --check --diff
```

Auto-format code:

```bash
ruff format
```

üí° You can also install the [Ruff VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) to auto-format on save.

### Objectives:

- Identify tree species sensitive to fires, storms, disease, and pests.
- Promote diverse, resilient tree stands over vulnerable monocultures.
- Enable cost-effective, large-scale forest health monitoring.

### Long-Term Goals:

- Present findings at well recognized Polish conferences ([MLinPL](https://mlinpl.org), [GHOST Day](https://ghostday.pl)).
- Contribute to the open-source [Deepness](https://github.com/PUTvision/qgis-plugin-deepness) project.

Supported by the **Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (IRIM)** at **Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology (PUT)**.

<!-- The specifics of the contribution process to be determined -->

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any
contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also
simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`):
    - the name of the branch should identify the issue it addresses (e.g. issue number and/or some explanation).
    - branch can also be created directly inside an issue: https://shorturl.at/3KkQP.
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`):
    - commit messages should be created according
      to [the Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) framework.
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
